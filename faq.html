<h1>Hold on, I have questions!</h1>

<h2>General</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>So what is this <em>New York City</em> that I hear so much about?</dt>
  <dd>It's the <a href="http://www.nycgo.com/">center of the universe</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Personal</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Who are you people?</dt>
  <dd>Adri and Aleksey are graduates of Cornell University (class of '06 and '01, respectively).
     They met in 2003 through a mutual friend.  Aleksey proposed in Paris in September 2010.  They currently reside in Boston.</dd>
  <dt>Are you registered anywhere?</dt>
  <dd><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wedding/1I590WMQ4KV12">Amazon</a></dd>
  <dt>Why aren't you having a ceremony?</dt>
  <dd>We're having a private five-person ceremony on Saturday afternoon.</dd>
  <dt>I have some questions, concerns, comments that aren't addressed here. <a name="contactinfo">What is the best way to get in touch with you?</a></dt>
  <dd>Please email us at adri.and.aleksey@gmail.com</dd>

<h2>The Reception</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>What should I wear?</dt>
  <dd>We recommend suits and cocktail dresses. There will be dancing, so dress appropriately.</dd>
  <dt>Can I bring a guest?</dt>
  <dd>Please don't bring anyone whose name wasn't on the invitation.</dd>
  <dt>How do I get to the reception?</dt>
  <dd>We recommend taking the Q train to Brighton Beach. Use the Brighton 5th Street exit 
  and walk west down Brighton Beach Avenue towards the restaurant. If you absolutely must 
  drive (don't!), the restaurant offers valet parking for $15.</dd>
  <dt>I'm not a vegetarian, but I don't eat <em>seafood/red meat/pork/etc</em>. What option should I select?</dt>
  <dd>Dinner will involve a wide variety of things, and we're sure
  you'll find plenty to eat, whatever your dietary preferences. If you
  have a food allergy or sensitivity, please let us know so we can
  make sure dishes are labeled appropriately.</dd>
  <dt>I said I was coming, and now I can't make it. What should I do?</dt>
  <dd>Please let us know as soon as possible (email is best).</dd>
